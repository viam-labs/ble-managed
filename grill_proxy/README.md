[!WARNING]
The grill proxy code is a work in progress.

# Grill proxy

The grill proxy is a SOCKS proxy process. It will automatically create connections to phone proxies
and can route all SOCKS requests through those proxies.

# Building

Can only build on linux. Run `make setup` (will only try `apt`) and `make build` to build. Run
`make` or `make run` to run.
